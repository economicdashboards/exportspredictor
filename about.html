            <h2>About the Export Predictor</h2>
            <a name="intro"></a>
            <h3>Rationale</h3>
            <p>
              Acquiring productive capabilities in a wider range of goods
              is a key driver of economic growth and development. Countries typically
              diversify their economies as they pull out of poverty and only
              start to specialise (and innovate) at a relatively late stage of the development
              process — a pattern well documented in terms of
              <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/aea/aer/2003/00000093/00000001/art00004" target="_blank">production, employment</a> and
              <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/REST_a_00078#.WGYYERJ95hE" target="_blank">exports</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Developing countries must learn to produce and export new products,
              but economists
              <a href="http://hajoonchang.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/DPRLin-Changdebate.pdf" target="_blank">do not agree</a>
              whether industrial policy should conform to or defy comparative advantage. Many experts
              believe it is not possible to predict viable industries, or ‘pick winners’.
              Yet policy makers need to prioritise
              <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1824519" target="_blank">limited</a>
              administrative capabilities. A prerequisite for a successful
              industrial policy is the identification of new industries that are
              (or can become) economically feasible  —
              areas of ‘latent comparative advantage’.
            </p>
            <p>
              So how can policy makers identify these
              sectors? Justin Lin's
              <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1611526" target="_blank">
                Growth Identification and Facilitation</a> framework proposes a simple
                if ad-hoc approach, which is probably followed in some form by most
                countries:
              <p>
                <blockquote>
                The government in a developing country can identify the list of tradeable
                goods and services that have been produced for about
                20 years in dynamically growing countries with similar endowment
                structures and a per capita income that is about 100% higher than
                their own.
              </blockquote>
            </p>
            <p>
              Research into economic complexity may provide
              a more data-driven solution. Global trade data is mined to
              <a href="http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/visualize/network/hs92/export/usa/all/show/2014/" target="_blank">map</a>
              out the network of possible exports and the paths of productive knowledge
              between then. Policy makers can then restrict their attention to
              industries that are close to their current productive structure but
              offer the opportunity to move into denser areas of the
              product space.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Export Predictor applies the intuition of Lin's
              approach in a systemic manner inspired by the product space.
              Rather than measuring the distance between products, the focus is
              the proximity of countries. Economically feasible industries are
              identified based on the comparative advantage of ‘nearby’ countries.
              Multiple measures of country distance are combined in a machine
              learning model trained to predict export discoveries.
            </p>
            <a name="data"></a>
            <h3>Data</h3>
            <p>
              The Export Predictor is built using international trade data from
              <a href="https://comtrade.un.org/" target="_blank">UN Comtrade</a>.
              The data used covers the last 20 years, over 200 countries and more than
              1,200 products. Data reported by the importing country is generally more reliable and used unless missing
              (in which case data reported by the exporter is used). Some products such as oil are
              excluded as they depend more on natural resource endowments than productive knowledge.
            </p>
            <a name="proximity"></a>
            <h3>Country proximity</h3>
            <p>
              Distance between countries is measured along the following dimensions:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Products exported</strong> (how similar countries are in terms of
                the products they export).</li>
              <li><strong>Products imported</strong> (how similar countries are in terms of
                  the products they import).</li>
              <li><strong>Destination of exports</strong> (how similar countries are in terms
                  the countries they export to).</li>
              <li><strong>Origin of imports</strong> (how similar countries are in terms
                  the countries they import from).</li>
              <li><strong>Bilateral trade intensity</strong> (the value of trade between two
                  countries, normalised by their share of global trade).</li>
              <li><strong>Geographic distance</strong> (the number of kilometers between each capital
                city).</li>
           </ul>
           <p>
             The networks of country proximity according to each measure are visualised
             <a href="networks.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
           </p>
           <a name="predictions"></a>
           <h3>Export predictions</h3>
           <p>
             The objective is to predict ‘export discoveries’. To limit
             noise in the data, a country is considered to
             have discovered a new product after exporting it for three
             consecutive years. Likewise, only products not exported for three
             consecutive years are considered potential new discoveries.
           </p>
           <p>
             Considering only completely new products will not generate useful predictions for
             industrialised and large emerging economies that already
             export most of the products in the database. The model
             is therefore separately trained to also predict new areas of comparative
             advantage. A country is said to have revealed comparative advantage
             if it's export share of a product exceeds that product's share
             in global trade. UN Comtrade data is used to identify all
             ‘discoveries’ over the last two decades according to both of these definitions.
          </p>
           <p>
             The neighbours of each country (according to the proximity measures defined above)
             are ranked. The
             <span class="gTerm" style="cursor:help;"
             title="revealed comparative advantage is defined as the share of a country's exports accounted for by a product, normalised by that product's share in global trade.">
             comparative advantage</span>
             of each neighbour in each potential discovery is then computed.
             To increase predictive power and reduce computational requirements,
             the comparative advantage of all the neighbours is projected on to the
             most discriminative direction with respect to export discoveries
             in the previous year (using Linear Discriminants Analysis).
             The model also takes account of the past discovery rate
             for each country and product.
           </p>
           <p>
             Finally, the
             <a href="https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost" target="_blank">XGBoost</a>
             algorithm is trained to predict the probability of a given country discovering
             (or developing comparative advantage in)
             a given product. The discoveries predicted within
             the next three years can be explored
             <a href="dashboard.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
           </p>
           <a name="evaluation"></a>
           <h3>Model evaluation</h3>
           <p>
             The emergence of new export industries is relatively rare: the
             product discovery rate is around 3%. Developing a new comparative
             advantage is even rarer: the average discovery rate is less than 1%.
             The probability ranking across products
             or countries is as (or more) important than obtaining a correct binary
             classification (export discovery or not). In these situations, the
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic" target="_blank">
             receiver operating characteristic (ROC)</a> curve is often used
             to evaluate a model’s predictions. This a plot of
             the true-positive rate against the false positive rate at different
             discrimination (probability) thresholds, after testing the model on new data.
           </p>
           <p>
            For example, the ROC curve below was generated by training the model on
            data from 1996 to 2012 and evaluating its predictions against the actual
            product discoveries between 2013 and 2015. The potential new
            exports with a predicted probability of at least 3%
            include almost all of the true positives (products that were indeed
            discovered). However, almost 20% of these products were not discovered
            (were false positives). Using a higher threshold will eliminate
            most false positives, but at the cost of excluding products that
            were discovered.
           </p>
           <img width="700" src="images/roc_curve_no_labels.png" onmouseover="hover(this);" onmouseout="unhover(this);" />
           <p>
             The area under the ROC curve (AUC) provides a measure of the model’s
             overall performance, or more specifically how well it ranks the
             probabilities of potential exports. An AUC score of 0.5 indicates the model is no better
             than a random guess, whereas the maximum score of 1 indicates no false positives
             and no false negatives. When evaluated with the most recent data, the export
             prediction model scores around 0.95 (see chart below). This means
             that 95% of the time a randomly chosen product
             that is discovered will have a higher predicted probability than
             a randomly chosen product that is not. The model’s performance
             continues to improve as more data becomes available, providing
             assurance future predictions should be no less reliable. When trained
             to predict comparative advantage the model scores even higher:
             with an AUC score of 0.98.
            <img width="700" src="images/Leave-last-year-out cross validation.png"/>
           </p>
           <a name="limits"></a>

           <h3>Limitations and modifications</h3>
           <p>
             The Export Predictor was designed primarily for policy makers
             in developing countries. The predictions may not be useful for
             every country, particularly those close to the technological
             frontier that are more likely to discover new products through
             innovation than diffusion of existing knowledge.
           </p>
           <p>
             The same approach could be used to predict other outcomes, including imports. Knowing
             which countries are most likely to import a particular product could
             help multinational companies plan their entry into new markets. The model may need to
             be re-trained using more disaggregated data, for
             example HS 6-digit level of classification rather than the
             4-digit level currently used.
